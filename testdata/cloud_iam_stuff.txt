Note: bindingID is generated from resourceID + random bits

#1 Query roles and their condition of policy's bindings:

SELECT role, condition
FROM iam_policy_binding
WHERE
	resource_id='12345' AND
	member_type='user' AND
	member='mike@example.com';

#2 Filter bindings by condition locally
bindings = loop bindings; match(binding, condition)

#3 Perform internal check with Zenia

Check for tuple:
    iam:<resource uid>#<binding role>@<user>
    e.g.: iam:12345#resourcemanager.organizationAdmin@`user:mike@example.com`
